CSS (style.css) :-
==================

Circles are drawn using SVG with stroke animations.

Each unit (hours, minutes, seconds) has its own color theme (Red, Orange, Green).

Dots glow and rotate around the circle edges like analog clock hands.

JavaScript (script.js) :-
========================
Runs a setInterval() function that updates every second.

Fetches the current time using new Date().

Converts 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM.

Updates :-

Hours, Minutes, Seconds text in the HTML.

Circle strokeDashoffset to show progress (like filling the ring).

Dots rotation to simulate analog clock movement.
